I"¿<p>I am Abdon Troche. I have a background in electronic engineering with enphasis in mechatronics, and I am currently working as a CTO in a Paraguayan Startup that manufacture bicycles and e-bikes. The Startup name is <a href="https://www.rodbicycles.com/">ROD Bicycles</a>.</p>

<p>While attending university I worked doing prosthetics hands and arms in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/poparaguay/">Po Paraguay</a>.</p>

<p>For long time I volunteer in an American space called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BenjaminFranklinScienceCorner/">Benjamin Franklin Science Corner</a>.</p>

<p>I also did internship in the <a href="https://www.fablabs.io/labs/fablabcidi/">Fab Lab CIDi</a>. After that they gave me a scholarship for the Fab Academy in Lima-Peru in 2019. Here you can find my <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2019/labs/tecsup/students/abdon-rotela/">Fab Academy website</a>. Three years later I become a Fab Academy Instructor in the first Fab Academy made in Paraguay, here you can take a look, <a href="https://fabacademy.org/2022/labs/cidi/">Fab Academy 2022 at the Fab Lab CIDi</a>.</p>

<p>All of this gave me an immeasurable knowledge about digital fabrication and machine building skills.</p>
